### The URL(s) where the original data was located:
[SMC Health Directory](https://smchealthonline.com/directory/index.php?ID=&site_city=&site_zip=&languages=&site_specialty=&search=y)

### My scraping code:
[smc_mh_scrape.rb](smc_mh_scrape.rb) for the scraping code

I also tried scraping another [SMC website](http://cdn.smchealth.org/directory.html) but ran into some issues, so you can see my _failed_ scrape attempt in [FAILED_smc_site2_scrape.rb](FAILED_smc_site2_scrape.rb).

### A csv or json file with the data:
[FINALDATA_smc_scraped.csv](FINALDATA_smc_scraped.csv)
